            <p>
                I feel like the first site I think of when I think of white space is Apple. They
                do such a good job of having the perfect balance of a clean white space while still
                using it to accentuate their products perfectly.

            <img id=pic1 src="images/IMG_3401.PNG" alt="A screen shot Of Conde Nast's web">
            <p>As soon as you open the Conde Nast site, you immediately see graphics
                that really highlight what the company loves and promotes. They do an
                amazing job of really showcasing that right off the bat and having a very 
                strong visual site.

            <img id=pic1 src="/images/IMG_3402.PNG" alt="A screen shot Of Rolling Stone's website">
            <p>Rolling Stone is a great example of the rule of thirds. They have immediately
                featured 3 different graphics for different stories of different topics and 
                also have at least three different categories of stories and links to different 
                topics that showcase the rule fo thirds perfectly.
